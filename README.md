### Goal:
Project PRISM aims to combat misconceptions about the complex phenomenon of internal geographic mobility in the United States.  

### Project Description/Outline:
* Since data about multiple migrations is hard to understand; PRISM provides data visualizations as a prism through which to better understand them.

### Research Questions to Answer:
* Where are internal migrants in the US coming from? Where are they going instead?
* Why are internal migrants in the US crssing state lines to move? 
* What other push and pull factors affect this phenomenon and How.
